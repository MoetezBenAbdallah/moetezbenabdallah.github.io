Hey, my name is Moetez Ben Abdallah a Junior Penetration Tester and Cybersecurity Enthusiast. 
I'm passionate about offensive security and I love diving into CTFs on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe.
I created this blog to share writeups, document my learning journey, and provide tips on certifications like the eJPT and more. 
I believe in learning by doing, and this space is where I grow and hopefully help others grow too.
