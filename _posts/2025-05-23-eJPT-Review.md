## eJPT Overview

Hey everyone! I’m Moetez Ben Abdallah, and I’m excited to finally share my thoughts on the **eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** certification, which I passed back in **October 2024**.

This review is based on my own journey preparing for and completing the exam. I hope it helps clarify what to expect and gives others a clear idea of how to approach it. Everything mentioned here is for educational purposes only.

## Course Lab

The eJPT exam consists of **35 questions**, and you must achieve a passing score of **70%**. You have **48 hours** to complete the exam, and it costs **$250** for a 3-month subscription, which includes one voucher. Based on my **hands-on experience** and extensive preparation, this roadmap focuses on practical knowledge and the skills required to pass the exam efficiently.

## What is eJPT?

The **eJPT** is an entry-level, hands-on penetration testing certification provided by INE. Unlike traditional multiple-choice certs, the eJPT challenges you to perform actual attacks in a lab environment simulating what a real junior pentester might do.

You’ll need to perform **network reconnaissance, enumeration, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and basic post-exploitation** answering scenario-based questions along the way.

## Why I Took the eJPT

During winter 2024, I wanted to solidify my offensive security fundamentals and get hands-on experience. I had been spending time on platforms like **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**, but I was looking for something structured with real-world value that’s where **eJPT** came in.

I saw it as the perfect stepping stone to bigger goals like **CRTP** and **PT1**, both of which I’m currently preparing for.

## Preparation and Prerequisites

Before diving into the exam, here's what helped me build my foundation:

- Understanding **networking basics** (subnets, ports, TCP/IP)
- Comfortable with **Linux and Windows terminal**
- Hands-on practice with tools like `nmap`, `Wireshark`, `Burp Suite`, `Nikto`, and `Hydra`
- Consistent practice through **PTSv1 labs**, **TryHackMe**, and **HackTheBox**

INE’s **Penetration Testing Student v1 (PTSv1)** course is the official prep material, and it matches the exam content very well. The labs are where the real learning happens. Don’t just watch videos, replicate and experiment. 

---

## Exam Experience

The exam gives you **48 hours** of lab time to compromise several machines and answer 20 questions based on your findings. I completed mine in about **9 hours**, including breaks and double-checking answers.

There’s **no report writing**, but make no mistake, this is a **hands-on, skill-based exam**. Every question is tied to an action you take in the lab. It’s not enough to know the commands - you have to **understand the process and logic** behind each step.

## What I Loved

✅ **Hands-on from start to finish**  
✅ **Beginner-friendly, but real-world focused**  
✅ **No trick questions or fluff**  
✅ **Great prep for CRTP/PT1-level work**  
✅ **Affordable and self-paced**

## Tips for the Exam

📝 **Take good notes** while studying : They’ll save you in the exam  
🔁 **Reset the lab if things break or seem off**  
💡 **Focus on the exam objectives** : Don’t go down rabbit holes  
🧠 **Practice methodical thinking** : Scan, analyze, attack, repeat  
☕️ **Take breaks** : Fresh eyes = Faster progress  
🛠️ **Know your tools, but also your logic** : What are you trying to prove?

---

## Final Thoughts

For me, the **eJPT** wasn’t just an exam it was a launchpad. It gave me the confidence to tackle more advanced concepts, and it’s a certification I recommend to anyone serious about breaking into the field.

Now I’m focused on preparing for the **Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)** and **TryHackMe Penetration Testing (PT1)**, pushing deeper into AD security and threat analysis. I’ll be sharing my journey on those soon so stay tuned!

Thanks for reading. Feel free to reach out if you’re studying for eJPT or just getting started in cybersecurity!
